How to use our code:

1. run the server class
2. run client class how many times do you want to add clients in the chat, 
I mean if you want three users run client class 
at the first time, type user name without spaces and only one word.
do the same with other users do you want to chat with them. If you type the same user name it will 
automatically add the number of clients as example the first user has username 'Sina',the second user
typed the same user name it will be directly 'Sina2' and so on.

3. Now all users online in chat,you can choose following instructions to test the code.

4. Type ProgramInfo to get lists of instructions:
Type 'online' to get all connected users. 
Type 'logout'to logout and finish your chat.
Type '*set' to set superuser.
Type '@private Username' to send a message to a specific user.
Type '#super' to become a SuperUser 
Type '&block Username' to ban a specific user from the server.

All the instructions without ''.
For braodcast messages to all connected users, you can write the message directly without any thing.	
For '*set' just for the server to recieve the name, can never be used by user.
